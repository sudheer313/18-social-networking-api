# 18-social-networking-api

## Your Task

## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
```

## What I learned

This application helped me to understand basic MVC structure and also routes structure in mvc pattern
I also learned to how to define controllers and handlebars
I also understood concept of Authorization and Authentication. I also came across session storage.

## Challanges

At start I was unable to understand contollers. I was unbale to figure out about back-end and front-end routes at start. But after careful understanding of concepts this helped me to congigure this app.
I am also thankful to BCS who helped me through the process when I was struck in the due process of execution.
